# Neural-FCA

This repository is the implementation of a big homework on the course "Ordered Sets in Data Analysis", taught at HSE University in the first semester of the master's program "Data Science"

Course repository on GitHub: [link](https://github.com/MariiaZueva/neuralFCA).

The topic of my big homework is **neural Formal Concept Analysis (neural FCA)**. Neural FCA repository on GitHub: [link](https://github.com/MariiaZueva/neuralFCA)).

## Repository structure

This repository consists of the following main files:
* [**neural_lib62.py**] is a library that provides the creation, training, and visualization of interpretable neural networks;
* [**diagnosis.csv**] is the dataset used in this work;
* [**BHW_neural (1).ipynb**] is my research;
* [**OSDA_Report_Big_HW (2).pdf**] is a detailed progress report;
* [**neaurla_javodov_sanjar_report_presentation.pdf**] is a presentation from a big homework defense.
